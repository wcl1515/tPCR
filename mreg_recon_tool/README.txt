Toolbox for reconstructing MREG data. Call mreg_recon_tool for starting the GUI.

Dependancies: You need the fessler toolbox which you can download from 
http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/ 

Nice to have: You don't really need the FSL Toolbox, but it's used to create nicer B0-maps that can be used for off-resonance correction. You can download it here:
